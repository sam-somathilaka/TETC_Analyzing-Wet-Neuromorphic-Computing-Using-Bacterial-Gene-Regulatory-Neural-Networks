# TETC_Analyzing-Wet-Neuromorphic-Computing-Using-Bacterial-Gene-Regulatory-Neural-Networks

This study integrates bio-computing with neuromorphic systems by transforming bacterial gene regulatory networks into Gene Regulatory Neural Networks (GRNNs) for biocomputing applications. We analyze the intrinsic properties of gene regulations, convert them into a gene-perceptron function, and introduce a sub-GRNN search algorithm to tailor network structures for specific problems. Using Escherichia coli as the model organism, we extract and validate a base-GRNN for accuracy. Our comprehensive feasibility analysis demonstrates the GRNNâ€™s computational capabilities in classification and regression tasks. Additionally, we explore the potential of applying GRNNs to digit classification as a use case. Simulation experiments indicate promising results for utilizing GRNNs in bacterial cells, thus advancing wet-neuromorphic computing with natural cells. This GitHub repository provides the required codes for the analysis.
