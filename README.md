# TETC_Analyzing-Wet-Neuromorphic-Computing-Using-Bacterial-Gene-Regulatory-Neural-Networks

This study integrates bio-computing with neuromorphic systems by transforming bacterial gene regulatory networks into Gene Regulatory Neural Networks (GRNNs) for biocomputing applications. We analyze the intrinsic properties of gene regulations, convert them into a gene-perceptron function, and introduce a sub-GRNN search algorithm to tailor network structures for specific problems. Using Escherichia coli as the model organism, we extract and validate a base-GRNN for accuracy. Our comprehensive feasibility analysis demonstrates the GRNNâ€™s computational capabilities in classification and regression tasks. Additionally, we explore the potential of applying GRNNs to digit classification as a use case. Simulation experiments indicate promising results for utilizing GRNNs in bacterial cells, thus advancing wet-neuromorphic computing with natural cells. This GitHub repository provides the required codes for the analysis.

## Classification Analysis

This analysis requires multiple scripts. However, we have only uploaded the main scripts to give the reader a comprehensive idea about the model. Description of each file is given below.

**1. Digit.py:** This file contain the digit shapes in binaries.

**2. GenerateOutputGEs_classification.py:** This script covers the first three steps of the application-specific sub-GRNN search algorithm. 

**3. FullVarAnalysis.py:** Atep 4 of the search algorithm is perfomed in this script.

** 4. FindingCommonGenesBinary.py: ** The fifth step of the search algorithm is executed in this cript.

** 5. ComputeConfussionMatrix.py: ** The suitable threshold level extraction done in Step 6 is perfomed by this script.

** 6. PurtabationAnalysis.py** and **PerturbationDataPlot** The final step using purtabation-based mutual information analysis is performed in these two scripts.
